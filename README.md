  --------------|-----------------------
  HTML          | [++++++++oo] Very semantic, clean; but lack constant linting habbit.  
  JavaScript    | [++++++++oo] Comes semi-naturally
  CSS           | [+++++++ooo] Pretty decent when it comes to deciding on layouts and execution, but occasionally I get stuck on single things for long periods of time.
  Git Commits   | [+++++++++o] Semi-frequent commits, clear and concise messages.
  Code Comments | [++++++++oo] My comments are very good, but only are there when I feel the need to add them.
  Responsive    | [+++++++ooo] I respond instantly...if my phone feels like actually telling me. Occasionally, my phone will just crap out for periods of time.
