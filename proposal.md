## Topic
  Our project 2 is based on recreating a reservation system for campsites.  Our project will work on resolving common issues that are experienced in current reservation sites such as:  
    * Incompatible with smaller screens (phones and tablets)  
    * Can't search for camp sites in multiple states.  
    * Images do not scale well on smaller screens.  
    * Filtering options not user friendly.  

## Communications
  All communications will be done through Basecamp.
